## üìåKey features
### Tab 1: Contacts Page
This tab simulates the contacts application of the Android phone by loading, adding, searching, and deleting the contacts stored in the actual phone. 
 - When the Contacts tab is selected, we see a list of all contacts retrieved from the actual phone storage.
 - Using the search bar on the top of this main page, we can search the contact by name and find the contact we are looking for.
 - On this main page, we can click on the phone or message icons to call or send messages to the selected contact.
 - Clicking on the contact will move to a page that shows the detail information of the contact. The phone and message icons here also allow us to call or send message directly. 
 - Each contact can be removed and deleted from the actual phone Contacts storage by simply swiping to the right.
 - We can add a contact by clicking the bottom right + button. This will add the contact directly to our actual phone Contacts.

### Tab 2: Gallery Page
This tab simulates the gallery application of an Android phone by loading, adding, viewing, and applying color filters for the images stored in the actual phone.
 - When the Gallery tab is selected, we see a list of all images retrieved from the actual phone storage in the order of the most recently taken photo.
 - Clicking on an image will redirect us to a detailed view of the selected image. We can zoom in or zoom out using finger gestures, or view the images with different color filters ( as a black and white image, original color image, or image that has been brightened).
 - In order to add a new image by taking a photo, we can click on the bottom right camera button. This will automatically launch the Camera application of the phone and allow us to take a picture. Once we confirm to use this picture, we will be redirected back to the main page showing all images. This photo is automatically be added to our phone storage and displayed.

### Tab 3: PresentAdvisor Page
This tab recommends gifts to give to others by asking simple questions.
 - When you click on the radiobuttons for the question in each fragment, you move to the fragment corresponding to the clicked result on the final screen.
 - If any of -the radiobuttons on the current page is unchecked, a warning message is displayed instead of moving to the next fragment.
 - When conducting a survey, press the next button to move to the next fragment and maintain the previous checked state when returning to the previous fragment. 
 - When you press the "Start" button on the initial screen, all radio buttons are unchecked.
 - Clicking on the gift photo on the results screen took you to the page where you searched for that product on Coupang APP.
